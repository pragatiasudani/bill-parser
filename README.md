# Fuzzy-Bill-Parser

The aim of this project was to create a bill/receipt reader for a better maintenance of housekeeping bills to keep a better record of bills with just a picture of your receipts. This report presents the program for such a task, which includes reading text as in the shop name and the total amount from the image of the bill using “OpenCV”(Python library), and “difflib”(Python library) and the concept of fuzzy logic in image processing and fuzzy logic in pattern matching. A description of the algorithm and theory of fuzzy logic, its applications, it’s advancement into neural network are followed by the program code written along with tested input and outputs. The program is finally implemented with a function to check the accuracy of the data processed from the text converted bill.
